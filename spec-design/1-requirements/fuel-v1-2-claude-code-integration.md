# Fuel v1.2 - Claude Code Conversation Integration

**Base Version:** v1.0 (see fuel_v1_0.md)
**Purpose:** Add Claude Code conversation monitoring and integration to capture development conversations alongside git activity
**Timeline:** Version 1.2 upgrade from v1.0

## New Features in v1.2

### 1. Claude Code Conversation Monitoring (New)
- Conversation logs for each project stored in ~/.claude/projects/<name-of-dir-cc-opened-in>
- In each project dir you have every conversation that occurred for that project in jsonl files. Unsure of format currently.
- Store raw jsonl files (copy them over as these get deleted after 30 days), parsed and formatted versions of conversations, and extracted bulletpoints of conversations, and stats (num exchanges, num tool usages, num tokens)
- Automatic activity log creation from Claude Code conversations

### 2. Conversation Processing and Analysis (New)
- Parse JSONL conversation files into structured data
- Extract key conversation bulletpoints using AI summarization
- Calculate conversation statistics (exchanges, tool usage, token counts)
- Link conversations to projects based on directory names

## Claude Code Integration Specification

### Claude Code Hooks Integration (Primary Method)

Fuel v1.2 leverages Claude Code hooks for real-time conversation monitoring, eliminating the need for periodic scanning and ensuring no conversations are lost due to the 30-day deletion policy.

#### Required Hook Configuration

Users must configure Claude Code hooks in their settings files (`~/.claude/settings.json` or project-specific `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionEnd": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.fuel/hooks/session-end-hook.sh",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "~/.fuel/hooks/prompt-submit-hook.sh",
            "timeout": 5
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### SessionEnd Hook Implementation

**Primary hook for conversation processing** - Automatically triggered when Claude Code session ends:

**Hook Script**: `~/.fuel/hooks/session-end-hook.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# SessionEnd Hook for Fuel v1.2 Conversation Processing

# Read JSON input from stdin
INPUT=$(cat)
SESSION_ID=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.session_id')
TRANSCRIPT_PATH=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.transcript_path')
CWD=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.cwd')
REASON=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.reason')

# Skip if session ended due to error or other non-completion reasons
if [[ "$REASON" != "clear" && "$REASON" != "other" ]]; then
    exit 0
fi

# Extract project directory name from current working directory
PROJECT_DIR=$(basename "$CWD")

# Create backup copy of JSONL file before it's deleted
BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/.fuel/conversation-backups"
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_${SESSION_ID:0:8}_${PROJECT_DIR}.jsonl"
cp "$TRANSCRIPT_PATH" "$BACKUP_FILE"

# Import conversation into Fuel
curl -X POST "${FUEL_API_URL:-http://localhost:3000}/api/claude-code/import" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FUEL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"file_path\": \"$BACKUP_FILE\",
    \"project_directory_name\": \"$PROJECT_DIR\",
    \"session_id\": \"$SESSION_ID\",
    \"trigger_source\": \"session_end_hook\"
  }" \
  --silent --show-error

exit 0
```

#### UserPromptSubmit Hook Implementation

**Secondary hook for real-time tracking** - Provides live session monitoring:

**Hook Script**: `~/.fuel/hooks/prompt-submit-hook.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# UserPromptSubmit Hook for Fuel v1.2 Real-time Tracking

# Read JSON input from stdin
INPUT=$(cat)
SESSION_ID=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.session_id')
PROMPT=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.prompt')
CWD=$(echo "$INPUT" | jq -r '.cwd')

PROJECT_DIR=$(basename "$CWD")
PROMPT_LENGTH=${#PROMPT}

# Send real-time session update to Fuel
curl -X POST "${FUEL_API_URL:-http://localhost:3000}/api/claude-code/session-update" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FUEL_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"session_id\": \"$SESSION_ID\",
    \"project_directory_name\": \"$PROJECT_DIR\",
    \"prompt_length\": $PROMPT_LENGTH,
    \"timestamp\": \"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)\"
  }" \
  --silent --show-error

# Add current context information for Claude
echo "Project: $PROJECT_DIR | Session: ${SESSION_ID:0:8} | Time: $(date '+%H:%M')"
exit 0
```

### Conversation File Discovery Process (Fallback Method)

#### Step 1: Directory Scanning
1. System scans ~/.claude/projects/ directory structure
2. Identifies project directories (each represents a different project)
3. Within each project directory, finds all .jsonl conversation files
4. Tracks file modification times to identify new conversations

#### Step 2: File Processing Pipeline
1. **File Validation**: Verify JSONL format and structure
2. **Conversation Parsing**: Extract messages, timestamps, tool usage
3. **Metadata Extraction**: Calculate statistics (exchanges, tokens, tools)
4. **Summary Generation**: Create bullet point summaries using AI
5. **Database Storage**: Store raw and processed conversation data

#### Step 3: Activity Log Integration
1. Create activity_logs entry with type "claude_code"
2. Create corresponding claude_code_conversations entry
3. Link conversation to project based on directory name
4. Set conversation start/end times from JSONL timestamps

### Conversation File Format Handling

**Expected JSONL Structure** (to be confirmed):
```jsonl
{"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": "...", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"}
{"type": "message", "role": "assistant", "content": "...", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:15Z"}
{"type": "tool_use", "name": "read_file", "parameters": {...}, "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:16Z"}
{"type": "tool_result", "tool_use_id": "...", "content": "...", "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:17Z"}
```

**Processing Logic**:
- Count total exchanges (user + assistant message pairs)
- Count tool usage events
- Estimate total tokens (or extract if provided)
- Identify conversation start/end times
- Extract key topics and decisions for bullet points

### AI-Powered Conversation Summarization

**Summary Generation Process**:
1. Extract conversation content from JSONL
2. Send to AI summarization service (OpenAI/Anthropic)
3. Generate 3-5 key bullet points covering:
   - Main topics discussed
   - Key decisions made
   - Files/components modified
   - Tools heavily used
4. Store bullet points in database for quick display

**Prompt Template**:
```
Analyze this Claude Code conversation and extract 3-5 key bullet points that summarize:
1. What was the main goal or task being worked on?
2. What key decisions or solutions were implemented?
3. What files, components, or systems were modified?
4. Any notable tools or techniques used?

Conversation: [JSONL_CONTENT]

Format as concise bullet points suitable for a development log.
```

### Conversation-Project Linking

**Directory-Based Project Detection**:
- Use directory name from ~/.claude/projects/<project-name> as project identifier
- Match against existing connected_projects.name or create new project entries
- Handle cases where Claude Code project doesn't match git repository

**Project Matching Logic**:
1. Exact match: project directory name matches connected_projects.name
2. Fuzzy match: find closest match in existing projects
3. New project: create new connected_projects entry for unmatched directories
4. Manual linking: UI to associate Claude Code projects with git repositories

## Data Flow Changes from v1.0

### Hook-Based Real-time Flow (Primary)
1. **Session Start**: UserPromptSubmit hook tracks active sessions
   - Creates preliminary session tracking entry
   - Links session to project directory
   - Provides real-time session monitoring in Fuel UI

2. **Session End**: SessionEnd hook triggers automatic processing
   - Receives transcript_path from Claude Code
   - Immediately backs up JSONL file to ~/.fuel/conversation-backups/
   - Calls Fuel API to import conversation with session metadata
   - Processing happens immediately, no polling required

3. **Conversation Processing**: Fuel processes conversation immediately
   - Parse and validate JSONL content from backup file
   - Extract conversation metadata and statistics
   - Generate AI summary bullet points
   - Create activity_logs entry with type "claude_code"
   - Store conversation data in claude_code_conversations table
   - New conversations appear instantly in unreviewed activity feed

### Legacy Scan-Based Flow (Fallback)
1. User triggers conversation scan (manual or automatic)
2. System scans ~/.claude/projects/ for new/modified JSONL files
3. For each new conversation file:
   - Parse and validate JSONL content
   - Extract conversation metadata and statistics
   - Generate AI summary bullet points
   - Create activity_logs entry with type "claude_code"
   - Store conversation data in claude_code_conversations table
4. New conversations appear in unreviewed activity feed

### Enhanced User Review Flow
1. User opens application (existing flow)
2. System fetches unreviewed logs including Claude Code conversations
3. Activity feed shows chronological mix of commits and conversations
4. User can expand Claude Code entries to see conversation details
5. Conversations marked as reviewed when viewed

## Additional Configuration for v1.2

### Hook Installation and Setup

#### Automatic Hook Installation Script
Fuel v1.2 includes an automated hook installation script that users can run:

```bash
# Install Fuel hooks for Claude Code integration
curl -sSL https://fuel.example.com/install-hooks.sh | bash

# Or download and inspect first:
curl -O https://fuel.example.com/install-hooks.sh
chmod +x install-hooks.sh && ./install-hooks.sh
```

**Installation Script Actions**:
1. Creates `~/.fuel/hooks/` directory structure
2. Installs `session-end-hook.sh` and `prompt-submit-hook.sh` scripts
3. Makes scripts executable (`chmod +x`)
4. Backs up existing Claude Code settings
5. Updates `~/.claude/settings.json` with hook configuration
6. Sets up required environment variables in shell profile

#### Manual Hook Installation
For users who prefer manual setup:

1. **Create hook directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.fuel/hooks
   ```

2. **Download hook scripts** (provided by Fuel installation):
   ```bash
   # Scripts provided in previous sections of this spec
   # session-end-hook.sh and prompt-submit-hook.sh
   ```

3. **Make scripts executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.fuel/hooks/*.sh
   ```

4. **Update Claude Code settings**:
   Edit `~/.claude/settings.json` to add hooks configuration (see earlier sections)

5. **Set environment variables**:
   Add to `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent:
   ```bash
   export FUEL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-fuel-access-token"
   export FUEL_API_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # or your Fuel server URL
   ```

#### Hook Configuration Validation
Fuel v1.2 includes a validation endpoint to test hook setup:

```bash
# Test hook configuration
curl -X POST "$FUEL_API_URL/api/claude-code/validate-hooks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $FUEL_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Response indicates:
- Whether hooks are properly configured in Claude Code settings
